# Custom-Mode-Function
mode user defind function
This is a custom user defind function I made for finding the mode measure of central tendency. 
The simpler way to use a mode function in python would be just to import the mode function from the scipy library. 
However, knowing how to code mathematical functions from scratch versus just importing them has a two-fold benefit:
1) Increased programming profiecieny
2) Being able to understand the mathematical function more thoroughly due to having to create the backend of the function yourself. 

Enjoy!
